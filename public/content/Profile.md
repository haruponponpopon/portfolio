- Welcome to my page.
- I am currently studying machine learning at the University of Tokyo, and I have a strong interest in solving problems in competitive programming. In addition to my studies, I work part-time in the field of machine learning.

## About
I'm a graduate student from Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. My passion for computer science was ignited in middle school when I placed third in a national typing contest. Since then, I've been fascinated by the field and have dedicated myself to studying it.
During my undergraduate studies at the University of Tokyo's Department of Electronic Engineering, I gained experience in various programming languages, including front-end and back-end web development, iOS app development, and Unity game development. However, what really excites me is the rapid development of AI technology in recent years. From self-driving cars to translation software, the possibilities seem endless, and I'm eager to contribute to the development of AI that can make people's lives easier and more convenient.
I believe that my background and experience have prepared me well to take on the challenges of AI development. I'm always eager to learn more and am excited to see where this field takes me next.
