## 自己紹介 de AR
I participated in a hackathon called "JPhacks" with three of my friends, and we developed a self-introduction app using AR. I was in charge of the backend. This app won the Nokia Prize, which was one of the sponsor awards. #Next.js #Prisma

## Data Visualization
In the "Information Visualization" experiment in my university's undergraduate program, I worked with two other team members to develop a website that displays newly opened and closed stores on a map of Japan, as well as corresponding graphs. We were awarded the "Most Useful" prize in the experiment. #d3.js #javascript

## Image Generator
As my graduation research, I developed an image generation support system for diffusion models using a genetic algorithm. When prompted, the system generates nine images and uses interactive evolutionary computation to propose images that match the user's preferences. #python #gradio
