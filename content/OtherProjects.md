## Debate by ChatGPT
I participated in an app development event using the chatGPT API called hackGPT and developed backend. Users can enter any topic they want to discuss, from "Should casinos be legalized?" to "Is climate change real?" Our app generates arguments from both sides of the debate, making it easier to engage in lively discussions with friends or strangers. And to top it off, the app even judges which argument is more persuasive, so you can see who comes out on top. #ChatGPT #Python

## Boid Simulation
In an experiment to create Game AI, I developed a software that simulates the movement of a school of fish. It creates a beautiful spectacle of neon-colored fish swimming in a tank, fitting for the Christmas season. The software utilizes the DBSCAN algorithm and boid algorithm. #Unity #c#
